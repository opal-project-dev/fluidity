## TransactableLiquity interface

Send Liquity transactions and wait for them to succeed.

**Signature:**

## Remarks

The functions return the details of the transaction (if any), or throw an implementation-specific subclass of [TransactionFailedError](./lib-base.transactionfailederror.md) in case of transaction failure.

Implemented by [EthersLiquity](./lib-ethers.ethersliquity.md)<!-- -->.
